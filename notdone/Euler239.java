Project Euler Problem 239
=========================

A set of disks numbered 1 through 100 are placed in a line in random
order.

What is the probability that we have a partial derangement such that
exactly 22 prime number discs are found away from their natural positions?
(Any number of non-prime disks may also be found in or out of their
natural positions.)

Give your answer rounded to 12 places behind the decimal point in the form
0.abcdefghijkl.
