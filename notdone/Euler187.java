Project Euler Problem 187
=========================

A composite is a number containing at least two prime factors. For
example, 15 = 3 * 5; 9 = 3 * 3; 12 = 2 * 2 * 3.

There are ten composites below thirty containing precisely two, not
necessarily distinct, prime factors:4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 25, 26.

How many composite integers, n < 10^8, have precisely two, not necessarily
distinct, prime factors?
