Project Euler Problem 136
=========================

The positive integers, x, y, and z, are consecutive terms of an arithmetic
progression. Given that n is a positive integer, the equation, x^2 y^2 z^2
= n, has exactly one solution when n = 20:

                            13^2 10^2 7^2 = 20

In fact there are twenty-five values of n below one hundred for which the
equation has a unique solution.

How many values of n less than fifty million have exactly one solution?
