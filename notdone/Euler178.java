Project Euler Problem 178
=========================

Consider the number 45656.
It can be seen that each pair of consecutive digits of 45656 has a
difference of one.
A number for which every pair of consecutive digits has a difference of
one is called a step number.
A pandigital number contains every decimal digit from 0 to 9 at least
once.
How many pandigital step numbers less than 10^40 are there?
