Project Euler Problem 91
========================

The points P (x[1], y[1]) and Q (x[2], y[2]) are plotted at integer
co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to form DOPQ.

There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be
formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is,
0 x[1], y[1], x[2], y[2] 2.

Given that 0 x[1], y[1], x[2], y[2] 50, how many right triangles can be
formed?
