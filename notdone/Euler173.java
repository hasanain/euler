Project Euler Problem 173
=========================

We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square
"hole" so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry. For
example, using exactly thirty-two square tiles we can form two different
square laminae:

With one-hundred tiles, and not necessarily using all of the tiles at one
time, it is possible to form forty-one different square laminae.

Using up to one million tiles how many different square laminae can be
formed?
