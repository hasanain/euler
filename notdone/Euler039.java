Project Euler Problem 39
========================

If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length
sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

                    {20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p < 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?
