Project Euler Problem 218
=========================

Consider the right angled triangle with sides a=7, b=24 and c=25.The area
of this triangle is 84, which is divisible by the perfect numbers 6 and
28.
Moreover it is a primitive right angled triangle as gcd(a,b)=1 and
gcd(b,c)=1.
Also c is a perfect square.

We will call a right angled triangle perfect if
-it is a primitive right angled triangle
-its hypotenuse is a perfect square

We will call a right angled triangle super-perfect if
-it is a perfect right angled triangle and
-its area is a multiple of the perfect numbers 6 and 28.

How many perfect right-angled triangles with câ‰¤10^16 exist that are not
super-perfect?
