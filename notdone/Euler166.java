Project Euler Problem 166
=========================

A 4x4 grid is filled with digits d, 0 d 9.

It can be seen that in the grid

                                 6 3 3 0
                                 5 0 4 3
                                 0 7 1 4
                                 1 2 4 5

the sum of each row and each column has the value 12. Moreover the sum of
each diagonal is also 12.

In how many ways can you fill a 4x4 grid with the digits d, 0 d 9 so that
each row, each column, and both diagonals have the same sum?
